More than just the two colonies in one patch (maybe don't even make it patches, 
	instead make it one large world map and you can spread out new colonies)

Add in other types of insects you can play as.
	-Termites
	-Fire ants

More complex AI

More dangerous insects/random events

	-Trash pile (randomly generated repository of food)
	-Ant lion
	-Birds
	

Switch between different ants(soldier, worker, queen, princess)

Maybe ant levels up longer he lives

Queen produces eggs
	set rate for egg production - higher rate = more sugari8
	ants take the eggs to the nurseries
	nurse ants take care of the eggs

Nursery
	set hatch rate for eggs
		higher hatch speed
			requires more sugar
			requires more ants
